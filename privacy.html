            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 24, 2025</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in the GenGo application.</p>

            <h3>1. Local AI Processing</h3>
            <p>GenGo utilizes on-device Machine Learning (specifically Large Language Models running via MLX Swift) to power its AI features, including the Sentence Generator and Chat Assistant. <strong>All AI processing is performed locally on your device.</strong> Your inputs, prompts, and conversations are NOT sent to any cloud server for inference.</p>

            <h3>2. Data Collection</h3>
            <p>The GenGo app allows you to track your learning progress (e.g., favorite grammar points, quiz results). This data is stored locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or sell this personal data.</p>

            <h3>3. Model Downloads</h3>
            <p>To function, the app may download AI model weights from a public repository (such as Hugging Face) upon first launch or when you choose to update the model. This is a one-way download. No user data is uploaded during this process.</p>

            <h3>4. Network Usage</h3>
            <p>The app may use your internet connection to:
                <ul>
                    <li>Download the initial AI model weights.</li>
                    <li>Check for app updates or grammar database updates.</li>
                </ul>
                Once the necessary assets are downloaded, the app's core features are designed to work entirely offline.
            </p>

            <h3>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.</p>
